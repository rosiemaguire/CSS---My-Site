        <h2>Why, hello...</h2>
        <p id="well-hi-there">
          Good morrow! My name is Rosie and I am an Application Support
          Specialist at Xplor Technologies. I have been working with Child Care
          Software since I joined Xplor Technologies in November 2020. Prior to
          Xplor, I studied a Bachelor of Education (Primary) at QUT. I began
          working casually in Child Care (OSHC) during the second half of my
          degree and stayed in the field for eight years. I have just completed
          a Python Course via Udemy, and am currently undertaking a Web
          Development course to further my knowledge and ability to engage with
          various programming languages. My current career goal is to become a
          Software Developer for software used in the Educational Field,
          combining my two passions of Programming and Education.

          <h3>T-SQL</h3>
          <p>
            I have completed online courses in T-SQL, PostgresSQL and even
            dabbled in a bit of MySQL. In my current role, I predominantly use
            T-SQL in SQL Server Managment Studio (SSMS).

          <h3>Python</h3>
          <p>
            I have recently completed an online Python course. I would still
            classify myself as a beginner as I have not had daily exposure to
            this programming language for work purposes, however I have the
            foundational skills and I learn quickly once I become immersed in a
            project.
